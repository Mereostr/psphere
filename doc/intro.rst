Introduction
============

This is the documentation for psphere, a project which intends to provide
native Python bindings for the vSphere Web Services SDK.

Warning
-------
I'm a novice programmer and psphere is my first project. I'm continually
learning new things so it's quite common for me to refactor code and rename
things.

As I move towards a usable code base and my skills develop I'll stop 
doing this and just live with what I've implemented. If you stumble 
across this project before that time, beware!

Usage
-----

See :doc:`examples` for various code samples.

Alternatives
------------

- vijava
- vijava with Jython
- vSphere SDK for Perl
- vSphere SDK for .NET
