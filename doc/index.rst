Welcome to pSphere
==================

Welcome to the pSphere documentation. pSphere provides pure Python
bindings for the vSphere Web Services SDK.

This project has no affiliation with VMware Inc.

Home page
---------
For now, it's all happening on my `my bitbucket page`_.

.. _my bitbucket page: http://bitbucket.org/jkinred

Why
---
Personally I am using psphere in an automated provisioning framework. I'm
learning Python and this is a project I can gain immediate benefit from.

Requirements
------------
- `suds 0.4`_

.. _suds 0.4: https://fedorahosted.org/suds/

Usage
-----
See :doc:`examples` for various code samples.

Warning
-------
psphere is my first Python project. I'm continually learning, so it's quite
common for me to refactor code and rename things.

As I move towards a usable code base and my skills develop I'll stop 
doing this and just live with what I've implemented. If you stumble 
across this project before that time, beware!

Alternatives
------------

- `VMware VI Java API`_
- `VMware VI Java API with Jython`_
- `VMware vSphere SDK for Perl`_
- `VMware vSphere PowerCLI`_
